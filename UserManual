Introduction
ELMaze is a maze game, in which the main goal is to guide a small ball through the end of various mazes, passing through small obstacles.
The game offers a set of both single player and multi player levels, which need the cooperation of both players in order to be solved.
 
How to Play
It is possible to controll the ball in two different ways. The first way, is by using the keyboard W, A, S and D keys (for player one) and the keys UP, LEFT, DOWN and RIGHT (for player two). The other one, is by using the mobile phone as a remote control, connecting to the computer through a socket. To control the ball, the player needs only to tilt the phone in the direction in which he intends to move. Before starting the game, the user can choose the appearence of the ball.

How to Connect Remotely
In order to play by using the mobile phone as a remote control, the user must chose the 'Phone' option as the ball controller before initializing the game (chosing the appropriate menu). After this option is chosen, a server is initialized in the computer and a game code is displayed to the user. This game code must then be inserted in the mobile phone in order to make the connection.

How to Solve the Levels
In order to finished the levels and beat the game, the user must move the ball throughout the maze to reach the exit. The exit is often blocked by a set of doors, which can be open by pressing the respective buttons, which are placed around the maze. In the multi players levels, the cooperation of both players is necessary to open the doors and to finish the levels with success.
